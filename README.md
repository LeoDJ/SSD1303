# SSD1303
Arduino library for OLED displays with SSD1303 controller.

## Connection
Which pins to connect where (based on a raw SSD1303 connection)

### SPI
| Display Pin | Connect to                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| VCC         | 12V                           |
| VCOMH       | 10 uF capacitor against GND   |
| IREF        | 910 kOhm resistor against GND |
| D/C         | any GPIO                      |
| RES         | any GPIO                      |
| CS          | SPI_SS / any GPIO             |
| D0          | SPI_SCK                       |
| D1          | SPI_MOSI                      |

## Recognition
- This library is based on the Adafruit GFX library
- Most of the basic code was adapted to the SSD1303 from the Adafruit_SSD1305 library
